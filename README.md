A PWA implementation of [@Ashfin T2Y's](https://dribbble.com/shots/14193355-Weatherly-Kit-P2) weather app design with a twist. Ashfin didn't provide the assests, so they're self created.

Using:

- Next.js React framework
- next-pwa
- vercel for deployment
- Typescript
- Blender for cloud assets
- open-weather api for data
